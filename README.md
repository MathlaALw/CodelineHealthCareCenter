# Project Progress Summary: Codeline Health Care Center
As part of our ongoing development of the Codeline Health Care Center System, significant foundational work has been successfully completed, setting a strong structural and architectural base for the system. The project is being designed following object-oriented programming principles and a modular architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clarity.

## 1. System Planning and Class Design
We began the project by thoroughly planning the class structure of the system. This "Planning Map" outlines the core entities of the healthcare center and the relationships between them. Each class was meticulously designed with clearly defined:

**Fields** : Representing the attributes of each entity.

**Data Types**: Chosen carefully to suit the nature of each field (e.g., int, string, DateTime, List<>, etc.).

**Access Modifiers**: Implemented to ensure encapsulation and data protection, using public, private, and protected as appropriate.

**Collections** : Where applicable, List<T> and other collections were used to model one-to-many relationships between entities.
